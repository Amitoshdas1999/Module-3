# <h1> Module-3 = Strings & Functions</h1>
  <h2>In this excercises, student will learn about strings in C programming and learn to declare them, initialize them and use them for various I/O operations with the help of examples and student will be introduced to functions (both user-defined and standard library functions) in C programming. Also, they'll will learn why functions are used in programming <h2>
